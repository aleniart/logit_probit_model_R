# Household Satisfaction Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop and compare binomial logit and probit models to predict the likelihood of satisfaction based on the below variables:

- Income: Average monthly income per person in the household.
- Expenses: Average monthly expenses per person in the household.
- Sex: Gender of the head of the household,
- Cars: Number of cars in the household.
- Satisfaction: Satisfaction with the financial situation.

The dataset used in this project is fictional.

## Project Structure
The project directory contains the following files:

- [`household_dataset.csv`](household_dataset.csv): Contains the raw data used for analysis.
- [`logit_probit_code.Rmd`](logit_probit_code.Rmd): R Markdown file containing the R code for data analysis.
- [`logit_probit_code.html`](logit_probit_code.html): HTML output of the R Markdown file, showcasing the analysis results.

## Instructions
To reproduce the analysis:

1. Ensure you have R installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the logit_probit_code.Rmd file in RStudio or any compatible IDE.
4. Run the R code chunks in the file to perform the analysis.
5. The output report (logit_probit_code.html) can be generated by knit button.

## Results
The analysis includes descriptive statistics, conditional plot visualizations, model estimation (using both logit and probit models), goodness-of-fit comparison, prediction quality assessment, ROC curve analysis and interpretation of model coefficients.
